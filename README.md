# **Supervised Learning + Offline Reinforcement Learning**

This project explores how to improve loan approval decisions using:

- 🔵 **A deep learning classifier** (predicts probability of default)  
- 🟢 **An offline reinforcement learning agent** (learns an approval policy that maximizes financial return)

Built as part of the **Shodh ML Hiring Assignment**.
